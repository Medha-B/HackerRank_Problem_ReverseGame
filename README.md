# HackerRank_Problem_ReverseGame
Akash and Akhil are playing a game. They have  balls numbered from 0  to n-1. Akhil asks Akash to reverse the position of the balls, i.e., to change the order from say, 0,1,2,3 to 3,2,1,0. He further asks Akash to reverse the position of the balls  times, each time starting from one position further to the right, till he reaches the last ball. So, Akash has to reverse the positions of the ball starting from  position, then from  position, then from  position and so on. At the end of the game, Akhil will ask Akash the final position of any ball numbered . Akash will win the game, if he can answer. Help Akash.
